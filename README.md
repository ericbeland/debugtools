#Debug Tools

A small collection of debugging tools to make sticky debugging situations 
easier to deal with.


* **log_all_exceptions** - Useful to trap lost eventmachine callback Exceptions.
* **log_all_require calls**  - Track down failure-to-launch errors where early failures.
* **tracing** -  A probe that will log all method calls. Slows programs down but gives a detailed execution history.
